Note: Sometimes the actual website name has spaces between the title words, sometimes it does not. Use the appropriate one.","URLS (also known as a link or ""web address"" or ""links""). Sometimes you are asked to research the website as a whole. Sometimes you are given a ""sub-page, related to a specific topic"" and you must research just that portion of the website. For example notice row 4: it is a sub-page (almost like a separate website) of the main Disney website. But on the right and the left you will notice it deals specifically with ""pin collecting"". If the website takes you to the homepage, do the whole website. If it takes you to a sub-page, just do that portion of the website.","State (the location of the company providing the website) as noted on their website (sometimes it helps to look on the ""contact us"" or ""privacy statement"" page.","City (as noted on their website)","Is using the website FREE or does it COST? Sometimes websites charge for its goods or services. Also, if a website is completely free to browse or if a great deal of it is free to browse, put ""free"" here. However, if clicking on most anything brings up a cost (must pay for it to see it), then put a ""$"" here (we don't need the amount).","Is REGISTRATION REQUIRED? If you can't get to the information without having to register first, then put ""Yes"" here. If you have to register to even browse, put ""Yes"" here.  But if you can see everything, or at least browse, without registering, put no. Note: MOST (not all) shopping websites require registration to buy something, so put Yes here. Examples: Both eBay & Amazon are shopping sites. However, eBay can be browsed and even researched to find out the history of items, without HAVING to register, so put No here. Amazon can be browsed, but provides little information outside of finding things to buy, so put Yes here.","Everything on the Web fits into one (or sometimes 2) of these 4 categories. The definition of ""find it"" is a geographic location (like locating a national park). Make the website fit into one of the following ACTIVITY CATEGORIES =  SEE IT (read the news, view a photos, read and research, check movie times, etc.)  SHOP IT (shop for it, trade it in, auction it, purchase then download it, online shopping, etc.)  DO IT (play a game, chat, update your blog, book a flight, listen to music, customize your computer, and ""sometimes shopping activities"", etc.)  FIND IT (locate London, check out the address of a restaurant in the Chicago metro service area, etc. = this is rarely used in this column). Pick the activity that MOST fist the MAJORITY of the website","Write a BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WEBSITE. Most often you can copy and paste a small portion of the ""about us"" section of their website to get a good description. It may even require copying and pasting a couple of sentences from different paragraphs within their website to make a ""well rounded description"". However, if you cannot copy and paste something directly from THEIR website, then you must write the description in your own words. YOU CAN NOT USE SOMETHING ANYONE ELSE WROTE - as that is ""copywrite infringement"". You CANNOT use something another website (example: Google, Wikipedia, etc.) uses as their description of this website, as this is also ""copywrite infringement"". The bottom line - if you cannot get a description directly from the website itself - write it yourself. Note: also notice from the examples below that the descriptions are not ""personal"" but rather speak to the general population (meaning they do not include a lot of ""us"" ""I"" ""you"" ""best"" , etc.). Keep anything personal or that relates to ""being the best"" to a minimum, even if you are cutting and pasting directly from their website.","Primary MSA (Metro Service Area) for ubExact Engine","SUPER CAT (this is the very top category this website will be categorized under = it is it's ultimate parent topic)","Is This OFFICIAL Website?
