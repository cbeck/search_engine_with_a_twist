<h2 class="center">ubExact&#39;s Submit-A-Link Program Boosts Content and Helps Under-privileged Children</h2>
<h6 class="center">New Search Engine Donates Monies to One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)<br/>for Each User-Contributed Link</h6>

<p>Fort Lauderdale, FL - <strong>October 28, 2008</strong> - ubExact, a new human-edited search technology that organizes content by action and geography, today announced an initiative to donate money to <%= link_to "One Laptop Per Child", "http://laptop.org/"%> (OLPC), a non-profit organization that provides low-cost laptops to underprivileged children around the world. For a limited time, ubExact will contribute $.05 for each unique link every user submits to ubExact.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional search engines, ubExact is designed from a user&#39;s perspective and eliminates the common frustration of irrelevant search results. Built for the user community, ubExact encourages collaboration of knowledge on various subjects, including valuable content from the Deep Web. Check out the <%= link_to "ubExact video", "http://ubexact.com/demo" %>, which shows the different ways users can access content using this search tool.</p>

<p>In addition to content collected by ubExact&#39;s editorial team, ubExact welcomes and encourages users to contribute to the evolution of human knowledge-based results through its Submit-A-Link Program. Since ubExact supports a &quot;user-contributed&quot; environment, the power and quality of content increases as more users share their Web-wisdom. Users that submit a set of 40 links receive the title of ubExactor. Once a user submits 400 links, they advance to the status of ubExpert. To promote user recognition, ubExactors and ubExperts are highlighted on ubExact&#39;s &quot;Hall Of Fame&quot; page.</p>

<p>&quot;We created this one-of-a-kind search tool for the user community,&quot; said ubExact Founder and CEO Wilhelmina Stephenson. &quot;Our human-edited content uses a horizontal architecture to speed users from one website to the next, while keeping the context of their search as they move across the Web. In addition, our technology can easily adapt to the future use of voice recognition in the next generation of everyday search. We&#39;ve also more than doubled our index since we launched in the beginning of September. And as we grow each week, we believe our new initiative to raise money for OLPC will spark further interest in user contributions.&quot;</p>

<p>ubExact&#39;s search organizes content, eliminates spam, ensures privacy, and increases efficiency in directing users to relevant results. On the ubExact homepage, users can use the map to narrow their search to a specific geographic metro service area (MSA). Or once they receive their results, they can cut their search by the actions See It (reference), Do It (entertain), Shop It (buy), and Find It (navigate).<span class="sup">SM</span> ubExact makes hard-to-memorize web addresses easy to access through its &quot;direct navigation&quot; method, which gives users the option to put a search term into the web browser address bar after the prefix &quot;ubexact.&quot; In addition, ubExact&#39;s history-tracking feature highlights all searches in one place, eliminating the need to ever touch the back button. The outcome is an easier, more relevant search experience.</p>
