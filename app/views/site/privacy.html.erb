<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p><strong>ubExact</strong>&reg; welcomes you to the World&#39;s Only Direct Navigation Search Engine. To clarify how our information service differs from traditional search engines and to protect you as a user we ask that you read our Privacy Policy Terms Of Use before you use ubExact.</p>
<p>Traditional search engines have begun to use their algorithms to build &quot;relevance&quot; at the expense of user privacy. Search engines and browsers have even been known to hijack a user&#39;s address bar or read the &quot;favorites&quot; a user saves on their personal computer - just to improve the relevancy of the results they present. However, most users don&#39;t realize that by downloading or signing up for specific services (which are usually provided free), they are giving legal permission to be tracked – indefinitely – by default. To stop those search engines and browsers from what many condemn and label as invisible tracking, and uninstall or deselect tracking mechanisms, users are generally on their own to figure-out how to &quot;opt-out&quot; of being permanently tracked.</p>
<p>ubExact does not invade the user&#39;s browser or favorites, or seek to track user-specific demographic information. ubExact ensures user privacy by using only &quot;short-term cookies&quot; for tracking system profiling (our search engine&#39;s performance, errors, etc.) and what we are rendering for the advertiser, such as keywords a user uses, etc. – but we do not actively pursue specific demographics of an individual and certainly do not invade upon what a user keeps on their personal computer. Furthermore, ubExact&#39;s system logfiles are consistent with Internet-based services &quot;though ubExact has chosen to delete logfiles every 60 days.&quot; Moreover, ubExact has designed its user session cookies to <strong>automatically expire when a user&#39;s search session ends</strong>, so users do not have to &quot;learn how to uninstall technology&quot; that few understand. ubExact realizes that privacy is paramount to the online community and works to preserve user trust by designing itself to be &quot;user-centric&quot;.</p>

<p>ubExact collects personal information when you use ubExact, including cookies, which will identify your unique computer, to enhance the quality of our services. However, ubExact user session cookies are set to &quot;automatically expire when a user&#39;s search session ends.&quot; Additionally, most browsers accept cookies, but you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent to your computer. Since ubExact relies on cookies to keep track of your search history during your search session, that feature will not function properly if you disable cookies on your computer. Additionally, our servers automatically record standard computer information consistent with Internet-based services that YOUR BROWSER SENDS US whenever you visit ubExact, which may include cookies, a trail of your search requests and which links you follow, your Internet Protocol address, your type of browsing software, and the date and time of your visit and requests. HOWEVER, ubExact logfiles are deleted every 60 days and ubExact session cookies automatically expire when a user&#39;s search session ends.</p>

However, we will transfer this information in connection with an enterprise sale or merger of ubExact. Additionally, we may provide information to law enforcement authorities, or in response to a court order, or to investigate suspected fraud, or to protect and defend the rights of property of ubExact, or protect the general public at large.</p>
<p>ubExact does not control sites not owned by ubExact that display as search results, advertisements, or links. However, ubExact may share, with sites not owned by ubExact, certain non-personal information about your use of ubExact such as session cookies, the number and type of terms searched for, or other files associated with our advertising network.

<h4>Limitation of Damages</h4>
<p>In no event will we, our officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors or assigns be liable to any party for any direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, special or other indirect losses (including without limitation, any loss of customers or reputation, economical costs, lost profit damages, technology damages, trademark, service mark, copyrights, intellectual property, costs of counsel, or any other expenses or losses) arising out of or in connection with this Terms of Use agreement, even if we are expressly advised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of how such damages arose.

Any provision of these Terms which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be severable from the Terms in that jurisdiction without in any way invalidating the remaining provisions of the Terms or the original intent of the Terms. The unenforceability of any provision in a given jurisdiction shall not deem that provision void in any other jurisdiction.</p>
